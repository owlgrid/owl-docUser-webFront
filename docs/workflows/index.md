# Introduction

## Core concepts

In a backend, every process is a workflow. A workflow is a function that is triggered by an event (API call, date, database write, etc.), that runs a set of actions on resources and that returns a result (log, HTTP response, etc.).

We placed workflows at the core of OwlGrid because they are the most flexible and robust way to build a backend. They can be used to build any kind of operations, from a simple CRUD to a complex machine learning pipeline.
