# Metadata

Metadata are additional properties that can be attached to any resource.

### Use cases

Metadata are used to add additional information to a resource. They can be used to add information that is not part of the resource itself, but is still useful to have. For example, a resource can have a metadata property that indicates the date when the resource was created.

It can also be used to group resources together in a semantic way. For example, a metadata "deliveryStatus" can be used to indicate whether a resource is in production, in development, or in testing (this metadata is not included by default in OwlGrid).

Metadata can be used to filter or find data in search queries.

## Metadata catalog

The metadata catalog contains the list of metadata terms that can be attached to a resource.
