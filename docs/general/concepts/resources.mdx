# Resources

Resources can be require to be well identified. This page contains the naming convention used to identify resources.

## Resources typology

There are two level of abstraction in OwlGrid: **technical** and **product**. The convention is to manipulate concepts at the **product** level (which contains the functional logic).

### Technical resources

Technical resources, also named `services` are technical components on which the resources are based. They are used on the technical level. There are not meant to be used in resources description.

A service is composed of a core that runs the logic and interfaces; Interfaces are used to communicate with other services (databases, etc.) and the outside world.


### Product resources

Base product resources are (non-exhaustive):
- Database: store and manipulate data.
- Hosting: host web applications and websites.
- Monitoring: monitor usage of your applications.
- Workflow: execute actions on resources.
- Administration: manage administrators, give right, monitor usage, billing, etc.
- OwlGrid documentation (this): know how to manage platform resources.
- Portal: manage all resources and usage through an user interface.
- Templates: use architecture templates and publish yours.
- Notifications: get informed about OwlGrid status, alerts and updates.
- Etc.

### Resources identifiers

Resources can be inherited from parent resources. They can be either a terminal resource instance, or a group of resources instances. Composition of the id: `[baseResourceName].[resources].[resource-id]`.

The base resource name can be either `owl`, or a workspace id (which is a diminution of: `owl.administration.organizations.[organizationId].workspaces.[workspaceId]`).

N.B.:
- Resources names are always in plural, even when only one instance is represented.

Examples:
- `owl.administration.organizations.cf1a9799-6fb9-4a76-aff7-612eea134909.workspaces`;
- `owl.administration.organizations.cf1a9799-6fb9-4a76-aff7-612eea134909.workspaces.6f1765bf-9599-4aeb-8f27-c42589899a0b`;
- `6f1765bf-9599-4aeb-8f27-c42589899a0b.administration.users`;
- `6f1765bf-9599-4aeb-8f27-c42589899a0b.administration.users.9aaf7519-6f1c-4235-9419-fc34869019f5`;

### Operations on resources

Operations are an action verb on a resource. Example: `get`, `set`, `list`, `create`, `delete`, etc. There are specified in the documentation of each resource.

Examples:
- `owl.administration.organizations.cf1a9799-6fb9-4a76-aff7-612eea134909.workspaces.create`;
- `owl.administration.organizations.cf1a9799-6fb9-4a76-aff7-612eea134909.workspaces.6f1765bf-9599-4aeb-8f27-c42589899a0b.getDetails`;
- `6f1765bf-9599-4aeb-8f27-c42589899a0b.administration.users.list`;
- `6f1765bf-9599-4aeb-8f27-c42589899a0b.administration.users.9aaf7519-6f1c-4235-9419-fc34869019f5.delete`.
