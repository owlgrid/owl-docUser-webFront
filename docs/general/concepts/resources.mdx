### Services

Resources are composed of services (in technical terminology: component-technical). A service is composed of a core that runs the logic and interfaces; Interfaces are used to communicate with other services (databases, etc.) and the outside world.

### Objects

Objects are entities used to store data.

#### Operations

A service interface offers a set of operations. Each operation has a name composed of an action (get, set, list, etc.) and an object name (Workspace, Perimeter, etc.).

Operations are identified following the pattern: `[resource-id].[action][Object-name]`. For example: `owl.administration.getWorkspace`, `owl.administration.organization.listAdministrators`, etc.

An operation has parameters and returns a value. Parameters can be related to data (payload) or to metadata (pagination, sorting, etc.).
