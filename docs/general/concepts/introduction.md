# Introduction

## General architecture

Before starting to administrate your OwlGrid platform, you should understand some concepts. The following schema gives an overview of the main components of the platform. These concepts are explained in the following sections.

## Resources

Resources are components that can be used to create applications. They are the building blocks of your platform. By default, OwlGrid provides you with a set of resources that you can use to create your applications: workflows and services.

The sections [workflows](/docs/workflows/) and [database](/docs/database/) give more information about it.

### Spaces and perimeters

An OwlGrid instance is called a [spaces](/docs/concepts/spaces). Inside a space, resources are organized in [perimeters](/docs/concepts/perimeters).

### Templates

Templates are resources configuration that can be used to reproduce configurations. They can be used to create new resources or to get inspiration.

Templates are maintained by the community and can be found on the [OwlGrid GitHub repository](https://github.com/owlgrid/templates).

## Identities

Identities are users that can access your platform. They can be created by administrators or by users themselves.

The section [identities](/docs/identities/) gives more information about it.
