# Introduction

## General architecture

Before starting to administrate your OwlGrid platform, you should understand some concepts. The following schema gives an overview of the main components of the platform. These concepts are explained in the following sections.


#### Applicative architecture

A **space** runs several resources that can be used to create applications. A **resource** is a set of services that can be used to create applications. OwlGrid can be self-hosted (spaces are open-source) or hosted by OwlGrid Cloud. Learn more about OwlGrid Cloud [here](/docs/general/hosting/cloud).

## Spaces

An OwlGrid instance is called a [spaces](/docs/concepts/spaces). 

## Resources

Resources are components that can be used to create applications. They are the building blocks of your platform. By default, OwlGrid provides you with a set of resources that you can use to create your applications: workflows and services.

The sections [workflows](/docs/workflows/) and [database](/docs/database/) give more information about it.

### Perimeters

Inside a space, resources are organized in [perimeters](/docs/concepts/perimeters).

### Templates

Templates are resources configuration that can be used to reproduce configurations. They can be used to create new resources or to get inspiration.

Templates are maintained by the community and can be found on the [OwlGrid GitHub repository](https://github.com/owlgrid/templates).
