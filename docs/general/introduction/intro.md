## Introduction

OwlGrid is a workflow-oriented cloud platform that helps you build, deploy and maintains robust backends in a minute.

Whether you need to create a backend for an application, to host a website or to manage integration in an information system, OwlGrid is the right choice. Focus on the development of your application and the OwlGrid will take care of the rest.

### A "workflow-oriented" platform

We though about: "what does a backend at its core?" and we came to conclusion that it *executes actions on resources*. So we developed a simple philosophy to focus on the core of the backend:
- [Workflows](/docs/resources/owl-workflow/introduction) are resilient programs triggered by an event (API call, date, database write, etc.), that runs a set of actions on resources and that returns a result (log, HTTP response, etc.).
- [Resources](/docs/general/concepts/resources) are entities that performs actions, store data, call external services. Here is a list of some resources OwlGrid provides by default:
  - [Database](/docs/resources/owl-database/introduction): store an manipulate data;
  - [Functions](/docs/resources/functions/introduction): execute serverless functions;
  - [Hosting](/docs/resources/owl-hosting/introduction): host websites accessible through the web;
  - Etc.

## Use cases

Start by exploring use cases on the [use cases page](use-cases).

## Hosting

OwlGrid is an open source platform. You can use it [on your own](/docs/general/owl-hosting/self-hosted) or with your own development team. The OwlGrid company also provides a fully [managed version of the platform in the cloud](/docs/general/owl-hosting/cloud) that allow you to start now implenting use cases without having to worry about the infastructure.

## Ready to go?

If you are very excited to start using OwlGrid, you can jump directyl to the [quickstart](/docs/general/quickstart/intro) to start using the platform in 5 minutes.

If you want to learn more about the platform, you can start by reading the [philosophy](/docs/general/introduction/philosophy) and [concepts](/docs/general/concepts/introduction) sections to have a complete understanding of OwlGrid.
