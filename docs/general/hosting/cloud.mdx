## Architecture

OwlGrid Cloud Control Tower is an Owlgrid space dedicated to Cloud Spaces management. This space contains the following modules:
- Organizations: stores and execute organizations processes. For example when a new customer creates an account on OwlGrid Cloud, it adds the organization (which is required to create and manage cloud spaces).
- Administrators: stores the list of administrators and execute processes (account creation, etc.). Administrators are related to one or multiple spaces.
- Spaces: stores spaces information (hosting, address, administrators, etc.) and transfer usage monitoring data to organizations and billing.
- Billing: stores billing information and execute billing processes.
