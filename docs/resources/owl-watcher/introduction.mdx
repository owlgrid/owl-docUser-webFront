# Introduction

The **watcher** is a technical resource that monitor everything that happens in a workspace and can also monitor custom data sources.

The watcher collects and exposes:
- **Logs**: Logs are records of events or messages that are emitted by resources like workflows, database or hosting. Logs are used to track the behavior of a system over time, and can be used for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes.
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring allow to observe the behavior of a system over time. Monitoring can be used to detect and diagnose issues, and to ensure that systems are performing as expected.
- **Alerts**: Alerts are notifications that are triggered when certain events or conditions occur in a workspace. Alerts are typically based on predefined rules or thresholds, and can be used to notify of potential issues in real-time.
- **Analytics**: Analytics involves the analysis of data to gain insights and make informed decisions (technical or business).
