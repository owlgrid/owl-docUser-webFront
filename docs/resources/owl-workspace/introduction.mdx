# Introduction

To get more information about workspaces, please refer to the general concepts [here](/docs/general/concepts/workspaces).

## Operations

### Create a workspace

To create a workspace, you need to have an account on OwlGrid. If you don't have one, please refer to the [quickstart tutorial](/docs/general/quickstart/intro).

<Tabs groupId="client">
  <TabItem value="portal" label="Portal">

Start by logging in to the [OwlGrid portal](https://portal.owlgrid.com/). 
  
Then, on the [workspaces section](https://portal.owlgrid.com/manager/workspaces) of the manager, click on the **Create a workspace** button.

To create a workspace, you need to provide the following information:
- **Name:** the name of the workspace. It must be unique in the organization;
  
- **Description:** a short description of the workspace (optional);

OwlGrid will generate automatically an identifier and redirect you to the workspace page.

After the workspace creation, you will need to connect a repository. The repository is used to store the code and the configuration of the workspace. OwlGrid supports only Github repositories for now.

On the first connection, you will need to authorize OwlGrid to access your Github account. Then, you will be able to select the repository you want to use. For more informations, please refer to the [repository section](#connect-to-repository).

  <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP API">
    This operation is available through the HTTP API but not documented yet. We recommend you to use the portal to connect a workspace to a repository.

### Connect the workspace to a repository

Every workspace needs to be connected to a repository that stores **the code** and **the configuration** of the workspace and its resources. 

:::info

OwlGrid supports only Github repositories for now.

:::

To connect a workspace to a repository, this workspace need to have at least one branch. This branch will be used to create the main environment of your workspace. For more information about environments, please refer to the [environments section](/docs/resources/owl-workspace/environments).

<Tabs groupId="client">
  <TabItem value="portal" label="Portal">

#### Logging

Start by logging in to the [OwlGrid portal](https://portal.owlgrid.com/). 
  
Then, on the [workspaces section](https://portal.owlgrid.com/manager/workspaces) of the manager, click on the workspace that you want to configure.

:::note

If a workspace is not connected to a repository, you will see a **Connect to repository** dialog everytime you access to the portal of this workspace.

:::

#### Connect to Github

Once the workspace portal is opened, the dialog "Connect your workspace to a repository" will appear. Click on the **Connect to Github** button. 

Make sure to connect to Github using an account that has access to the repository you want to use.

#### Grant access to repositories

Once you are connected, you will be able to select the repository you want to use. If no repository is displayed on the list, make sure that OwlGrid Github App is installed in the repository you want to connect. To install the Github App, click on the button "Grant access to repositories", choose the repository(ies) in which you need to install the app and click on the refresh button to make it appear in the list.

#### Choose the main branch

Once the repository is selected, you will be able to choose the main branch of the workspace. This branch will be used to create the main environment of your workspace. For more information about environments, please refer to the [environments section](/docs/resources/owl-workspace/environments).

#### Connect

Click on the button "Connect". The repository is now connected to the workspace and the main branch is created.

        method: 'secret',
        secret: 'secret',
        accountId: 'accountId',
        perimeters: ['owl.workspace.workspaceId'],
    },
    workspaceId: 'workspaceId'
});

// Connect the client (generate an access token)
await client.connect();

// Get the workspace
workspace = await client.getWorkspace();
```
