# Versions

## Introduction

When a workflow is edited, a new version is attached to it. The version is a snapshot of the workflow at the time of editing. The version is immutable and cannot be changed. The version is used to track changes to the workflow and to provide a history of the workflow.

### Difference with environment

An environment is about resources instances while a version is about resources instances versions. Versions are not linked to environments, but only to the changes that are done on a workflow instance.

In a git system, a version is a commit and an environment is a branch.

## Properties

### Identifier

Each version has a unique identifier auto-generated.

### Date and time

Each version has a date and time when the workflow was saved.

### Author

The author of the version is the user who saved the workflow.

### Retention period

Versions are stored for 30 days by default. It is possible to change this value by TODO.
