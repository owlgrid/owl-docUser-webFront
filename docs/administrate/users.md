# Users and groups

## Users

Users are physical persons and machines that can access and administrate the OwlGrid platform.

There is 2 types of users:
- Physical persons: users that are physically present in the organization.
- Machines: users that are not physically present in the organization. They can be also named "services accounts" and can access resources through dedicated interfaces (such as APIs or CLI) to do automated tasks.

## Groups

These users can be organized in groups. Groups can be organised in a semantic way to clusterise rights (cf. [administrate rights](/docs/administrate/rights)).
