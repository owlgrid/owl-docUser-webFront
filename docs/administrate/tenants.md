# Tenants

To start storing and using data, a **tenant** must be created. Tenant are hermetic entities (no reference to data stored in other tenant). 

The size of a tenant is unlimited and its performance is unique. Lastly, a dedicated cluster is assigned to each tenant.
We recommend creating one tenant per information system. You don't have to worry about space, performance or semantic consistency; the objects stored in it will be managed with dedicated perimeters.

To create a tenant, please enter its name (lower case characters, alphabet only, numbers and "-" symbol allowed). You will soon also be able to choose its hosting location and provider.

Please note that it is not possible to link data hosted in different tenants. It is not relevant to create several tenants to host the data of an organisation, regardless of its size.
