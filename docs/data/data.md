# Introduction

It is possible to write and read data as an OwlGrid user, or through a client application.
To declare a client application, simply go to the "applications" section of the administration portal, then click on "create a client".

Note: for the moment, only data manipulation through a client application is possible.

A client must have a name and rights.
